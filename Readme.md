# 🧠 Data Analyst Agent — Autonomous AI for End-to-End Business Intelligence

> **Built by [Jayandhan S]**  
> Architected using **LangGraph**, **LangChain Agents**, and **Gemini API**  
> This AI system automates the *entire* data analysis workflow — from messy raw data → clean insights → actionable business reports → stunning visuals.  

---

## 🚀 Overview

**Data Analyst Agent** is a multi-agent AI system that performs complete data reasoning and business storytelling just like a professional data analyst.  
It can autonomously:

- Ingest raw business data (CSV/Excel)
- Plan and preprocess the dataset intelligently
- Clean and validate it batchwise
- Generate deep business insights and case studies
- Visualize the data in clear, story-driven plots  

All orchestrated by a **Supervisor Agent** that reasons, routes tasks, and manages memory across agents.

## 🧩 Architecture Overview

The system is powered by **LangGraph** for structured agent orchestration and **LangChain** for memory, tools, and reasoning chains.

## ⚙️ Workflow Breakdown

### 1️⃣ Supervisor Agent
- The **core brain** of the system  
- Understands user intent and dataset type  
- Routes tasks dynamically to sub-agents  
- Maintains reasoning memory across all steps

### 2️⃣ Preprocessor Planner Agent
- Examines the raw dataset  
- Generates a detailed **preprocessing plan** (handling nulls, types, outliers, etc.)  
- Passes structured plan to the cleaner agent  

### 3️⃣ Cleaner Agent
- Executes the preprocessing plan batch-wise  
- Performs **self-validation** on data quality  
- Ensures integrity before moving to analysis  

### 4️⃣ Report Agent
- Analyzes trends, correlations, and KPIs  
- Generates a full **business report** with actionable insights and opportunities  
- Acts as an intelligent storyteller for the data  

### 5️⃣ Visualizer Agent
- Transforms insights into **clear and aesthetic visualizations**  
- Creates visual plots to communicate business intelligence effectively
