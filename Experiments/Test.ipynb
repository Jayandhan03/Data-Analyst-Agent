    "1.  You MUST first call the `eda_fact_sheet` tool to analyze the data's schema and quality.\n",
    "2.  Based on the fact sheet, you will decide on a single, precise action for each column.\n",
    "3.  Your action for each column **MUST** be chosen from this exact list of approved commands:\n",
    "    - `none` (Use this if no change is needed.)\n",
    "    - `convert_to_datetime` (For date-like object/string columns.)\n",

    "    - `drop_column` (Use ONLY if a column is constant or a useless identifier.)\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **SAFETY RULES:**\n",
    "    - Do NOT suggest any Machine Learning preparations (e.g., one-hot encoding, scaling).\n",
    "    - Do NOT suggest dropping rows. Handling missing values via filling is preferred.\n",

    "3.  **Apply Transformations**: Write and execute Python code to perform all required steps. You MUST write robust code to handle potential errors.\n",
    "    - **CRITICAL - For Date/Time Conversions**: When using `pd.to_datetime`, you MUST include the `errors='coerce'` parameter (e.g., `df['Time'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Time'], errors='coerce').dt.time`). This prevents the entire process from failing if it encounters a single invalid time format.\n",
    "    - **CRITICAL - For Dropping Columns**: Before attempting to drop a column, you MUST first check if it exists in the DataFrame (e.g., `if 'cash_type' in df.columns:`).\n",

    "4.  **Save Changes (CRITICAL STEP)**: After all transformations are applied, you MUST save the modified DataFrame back to the original file path to make the changes permanent. Use `df.to_csv(path, index=False)`.\n",

    "3.  **For actions like \"fill missing with mean/median/mode\":**\n",
    "    *   Load the CSV. Check for any remaining nulls using `df['column'].isnull().sum()`. If the sum is greater than `0`, it's a **FAILURE**.\n",

    "\n",
    "By explicitly telling the model to only output JSON and even showing it a schema snippet, you reduce its creative freedom and nudge it away from thinking it needs to wrap its output in a tool call.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach relies more on the model's ability to follow instructions perfectly, which can still be brittle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommendation: Use Strategy 1 (bind_tools). It is the more modern, reliable, and idiomatic LangChain approach for this problem. It aligns with how models are being fine-tuned for tool use and is less susceptible to prompt-following errors."
